# Image-classification-using-a-Convolutional-Neural-Network-
This project demonstrates image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network .The model is trained on the Intel Image Classification Dataset, which contain categories: Buildings, Forest, Glacier, Mountain, Sea, and Street. The project covers end-to-end steps, including data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction visualization.


# Intel Image Classification using CNN

## Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to classify natural scene images from the Intel Image Classification Dataset. The dataset contains over 25,000 images across six categories: Buildings, Forest, Glacier, Mountain, Sea, and Street. The main objective is to build, train, and evaluate a CNN model while applying data preprocessing and augmentation techniques for better generalization.

## Features
- Image preprocessing: resizing, normalization, and data augmentation
- CNN architecture with 3 convolutional layers, pooling, dense layers, and dropout
- Training with early stopping and model checkpointing
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
- Visualization of predictions on test images
